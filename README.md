# Nick Ballou's Website (https://nickballou.com)
A revamped version of my website, made with Wowchemy (formerly Hugo Academic) and deployed with Netlify.

I've made several customizations to the site, thanks to helpful tutorials from others - you can find an overview of those customizations in a blog post here: https://nickballou.com/blog/custom-wowchemy/
