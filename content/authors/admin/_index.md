Welcome to my page! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at [Yonsei 
University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/) and will be joining Samsung
Electronics as a senior engineer on January, 2024. 

My current research mainly focuses on the development of Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-assisted design automation software and
the development of design methodologies for memory designs. During my Ph.D., my
research was centered on improving the robustness of non-volatile memory-based
systems. This included work on conventional computer systems, non-von
Neumann-based architectures, and deep neural network accelerators.

Feel free to contact me about my research or anything else <a href="#contact">here</a>.
