Hi, welcome to my page!!! I am a Ph.D Candidate in DATES Lab, Yonsei University under the supervisor of Professor Joon-Sung Yang.
I received my BS degree in electrical engineering from Danang University of
Science and Technology, Danang, Vietnam and joined Sungkyunkwan
University, Suwon, Korea, in 2019 as a Ph.D student. I am a recipient of STEM scholarship for international graduate students
by Sungkyunkwan University, from 2019. My research interests include designing robust
architecture for emerging memory technologies, processing-in-memory and computationally efficient implementations of deep learning algorithms.
