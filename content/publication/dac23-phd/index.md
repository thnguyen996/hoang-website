abstract: "*This work is expected to appear in DAC'23 Ph.D Forum* <br>
Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (eNVMs) have been demonstrated as promising candidates
for the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) owing to their superior scalability,
non-volatility, and performance. However, current eNVM devices exhibit various non-idealities,
which hinder their utilization in highly reliable applications.
In this paper, by exploiting the intrinsic fault-tolerability of DNNs,
we propose several low-cost and efficient techniques to enhance the robustness of eNVMs-based DNNs."
