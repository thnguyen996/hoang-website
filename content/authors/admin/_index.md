</br ></br ></br > Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at
[Sungkyunkwan Univerisity](https://www.skku.edu/eng/). 

My research mainly focuses on improving the robustness of emerging non-volatile memory based systems,
including conventional computer system, non von-Neumann based architecture and deep neural network
accelerators. 

I'm blessed to be supervised by an inspiring and well-respected advisor: Professor Joon-Sung Yang at
[DATES Lab](https://sites.google.com/yonsei.ac.kr/dates/), [Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/)

Feel free to contact me about my research or anything else <a href="#contact">here</a>.
