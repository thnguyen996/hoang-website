</br ></br ></br > Hello! I'm a PhD researcher studying well-being and video gaming, with regard to both quantity and quality of play. 

A primary goal of my work is to make psychological research on games more rigorous and trustworthy. I'm deeply involved in [open science](https://nickballou.com/openscience) advocacy, training, and meta-scientific research. I serve on the QMUL Research Integrity Committee and as the Local Network Lead for the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org).

I'm supervised by a delightful team: [Prof Sebastian Deterding](https://codingconduct.cc/Publications), [Dr David Zendle](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/david-zendle(127e6f28-98bb-4662-a759-369391c609e6)/publications.html), and [Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html).

Feel free to contact me about my research or anything else <a href="#contact">here</a>.
