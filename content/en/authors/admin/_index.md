Welcome to my page! I am currently an engineer at Memory Business,
Samsung Electronics. My job/research interests include:

- Development of AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-assisted design automation
  software. 
- Developing methodologies for memory design, with a focus on non-volatile
  memory systems.
- Enhancing the robustness of non-volatile memory-based systems, including work
  on conventional computer systems, non-von Neumann architectures, and deep
  neural network accelerators.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about DIY projects. In my free time, I enjoy
designing electronic circuits, building robots, developing mobile apps and
websites, and writing blogs.

Feel free to contact me about my research or for any inquiries. You can reach me
at <a href="#contact">here</a>.
