Welcome to my page! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Yonsei
University and will be joining Samsung Electronics as a senior engineer
specializing in AI/ML applications in January 2024.

My research interests include:

- Development of AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-assisted design automation
  software. 
- Developing methodologies for memory design, with a focus on non-volatile
  memory systems.
- Enhancing the robustness of non-volatile memory-based systems, including work
  on conventional computer systems, non-von Neumann architectures, and deep
  neural network accelerators.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about DIY projects. In my free time, I enjoy
designing electronic circuits, building robots, developing mobile apps and
websites, and writing blogs. These activities allow me to apply and expand my
technical skills in fun and creative ways.

Feel free to contact me about my research or for any inquiries. You can reach me
at <a href="#contact">here</a>.
